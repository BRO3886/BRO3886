### Hey! I am @BRO3886 (Siddhartha Varma) 👋 

I'm a software dev from Delhi, India. 🇮🇳

I'm pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT Vellore, batch of '22. 🏫

Currently an intern [@groww](https://github.com/Groww), and maintainer and app lead at [@GDGVIT](https://dscv.it/g).

I have a keen interest in solving real-life problems with code. I like learning about every aspect of a product. From design to development to marketing. I like to build things with Flutter, Go, React. Learning jetpack compose whenever I get time 🚀
